Has been created and structured so as to become a
true utility instrument and means of exchange. EXIT’s value inherent
in a transferable digital token will enable holders to store and
preserve wealth, while engaging in commercial and consumer
transactions using EXIT token as the means of exchange.

EXIT token holders will be able to shop directly on designermall.io for
designer goods and accessories, thus enabling hundreds of millions
of retail users, designer brands, merchants, vendors and ecosystem
partners to participate in the crypto economy freely and easily.
EXIT Token is a digital currency that is at the
core of a powerful new luxury shopping
ecosystem based on encrypted and
permissionless peer-to-peer (i.e. no middleman)
payments globally, that solves multiple
problems. Subsequently, we will position EXIT
as a leading payments channel in the alternate
subsystems like Metaverse

Integrated Platform.
EXIT’s primer focus is on establishing a global platform for
conversion of any crypto asset into EXIT tokens. All you need to do
is connect your wallet to the platforms trading EXIT and decide
which tokens you wish to convert.
Users can choose to swap back to a cryptocurrency of their choice
their accumulated interest or use it to shop at any of the luxury
brands that are part of EXIT’s network. This will create a robust
ecosystem where users can not only draw value from their crypto
assets but convert them into tangible, real-world products from
the luxury sector.

EXIT is designed to meet the needs of the modern
lifestyle industry. The marketplace offers the first
crypto exit strategy to convert any coin to EXIT
token and directly shop designer brands FERI &
POSH as well as health, wellness, homecare and
others on a new platform. An already established
global community of 120,000 brand partners &

VIP consumers, Designer Token is ideally
positioned for entry into the crypto market.
As a second phase, we will merge the NFT concept with the essence
of luxury goods. This means we are able to assign a traceable,
digital identity to each luxury good, so that people get the value
they were promised. The blockchain-based NFT marketplace allows
users and owners of items to create such an asset that contains
information about the item’s history, origin, ownership, and other
character traits.
Anyone purchasing the NFTs on EXIT will not only own the digital
representation of the luxury goods but also the actual goods. Once
in possession of the crypto asset, they can either choose to hold
on to it, trade it with others just like any other NFT or redeem it on
the EXIT platform to get the actual physical product shipped to
their address. Meanwhile, all transactions including the purchase,
sale and possession of NFT as well as its accompanying physical
product will be recorded on the blockchain.

NFT Marketplace.
EXIT will act as a bridge between the physical luxury and digital
crypto world by enabling designers and manufacturers to generate
NFTs representing their luxury and lifestyle goods. These NFTs can
then be listed on our marketplace, enabling anyone interested to
browse through the marketplace and purchase the item of choice.
EXIT in its second phase will support NFT auctions on the platform.
We have determined that, in the longer term, the Ethereum blockchain
does not suit, and cannot meet, our needs, and the needs and best
interests of our token holders and users in terms of ease of use,
transaction speed, transaction volume, and transaction costs.

Accordingly we have turned towards a smart chain protocol and
will complete development and testing on the Binance Smart Chain.
This will provide EXIT with vastly improved transfer and transaction
speeds at next to no cost, and without the need for a clunky
“middleman” mechanism, as with ETH, to effect a transaction. We
have chosen BSC for its scalability, functionality and security
capabilities. It can take the proposed load of trillions of hashes. We
believe in the continuous development of BSC with further network
changes addressing many of the present issues with the original
bitcoin blockchain. As the list of companies and applications
supporting BSC keeps on growing for a stable foundation on top of
the POS protocol has created one of the most prominent
interoperability solutions in the sector.
We do not doubt that blockchain technologies are developing
rapidly, and intend to adjust EXIT’s development accordingly.
